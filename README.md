# 2021-daily-goal-app
This is my 2021 daily goal app! I keep track of all the foods I've eaten this year, the exercise I've gotten, as well as the days I spent doing my hobbies (piano, chess, and coding). I built this using the knowledge I've gotten from taking Colt Steele's MySQL bootcamp course. I wanted to build an everyday app that allows me to easily input my daily data into my database and show me cool statistics about how I'm doing this year.
As I am planning to use this app for the rest of 2021, I plan to optimize my code and implement more features for me to play around with. Some things I want to fix/implement are:
  - Allowing multiple statement queries for one connection (I learned about this after I had coded all of my routes in App.js)
  - Fixing scripting file issues to have a separate file for all of my ejs scripts to reduce the redundancy
  - Implementing cool statistics to show, such as graphs :)

This is one of my favorite projects so far, and I've learned a lot about writing SQL queries, relational databases, and connecting the front-end with back-end web development.
Here are some pictures of my applicaton:
